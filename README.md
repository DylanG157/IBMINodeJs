# IBMINodeJs
Nodejs application connecting to the IBMI to create API using express  - ODBC connection

Please note that a lot of the connection, and potential security information has been reomved

So if you just downlonload this application, and try and run it, it will not work, its to show the bases and personal achievement and nodejs understanding 

If you are a rpg developer, and want to use nodejs with your IBMI contact me and I will try and assist from my experince
